/**
 * Burrower AI - a trap-setting builder-brawler hybrid: builds weeds during
 * downtime like Drone/Hivelord (she has plant_weeds in her own
 * base_actions), and uses Tremor (a self-centered AoE knockdown) as her
 * opener whenever it's off cooldown.
 *
 * "Burrower should be able to use its burrow ability to go from one turf to
 * another, this helps ambush marines. Once out of the burrowing state, use
 * stomp, slash the enemy a bit, and burrow back to safety again" - Burrow
 * is dual-purpose on a real click too (burrower_abilities.dm's
 * use_ability()): clicking it while surfaced goes underground in place;
 * clicking it again while burrowed tunnels to wherever was clicked, then
 * auto-surfaces on arrival and knocks down anything standing on that tile
 * (Burrower.dm's do_tunnel()/burrow_off()) - a real ambush payoff, not just
 * a hiding spot. process_movement() below chains the two: burrow in place
 * while still approaching, then tunnel the rest of the way onto the
 * target's own tile once burrowed. can_act_while_immobilized() keeps her AI
 * ticking through both the "waiting underground" and "mid-tunnel" phases -
 * TRAIT_IMMOBILIZED would otherwise freeze the whole state machine, same
 * as it does for an ordinary knockdown, leaving her to resurface wherever
 * she happened to start rather than actually choosing to close in.
 *
 * Once surfaced next to a live target, use_caste_ability() below fights
 * normally (Tremor, falling through to plain slashes - "slash the enemy a
 * bit") for as long as the target's actually down or she's still healthy;
 * once it's back up and she's taken real damage doing it, THAT's the
 * decision point where she queues a tactical retreat (start_tactical_
 * retreat(), the shared hit-and-run helper) so process_movement() ducks her
 * back underground once there's room - a real decision reacting to the
 * fight, not a reflex after every opener or a coin flip after every swing.
