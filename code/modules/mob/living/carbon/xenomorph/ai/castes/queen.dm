/**
 * Queen AI - fundamentally different from every other caste's controller:
 * her default loop is hive economy (build the hive, sit her throne), not
 * chase-and-attack. She only drops into the shared combat loop (via ..() ->
 * the base tick()'s normal state machine) when a threat is actually visible,
 * matching the user's design: "if the hive is under heavy attack she would
 * assist if all other conditions such as the hive not needing eggs or
 * anything else check out."
 *
 * There is only ever one living Queen per hive at a time, so unlike every
 * other controller in this file, her AI is deliberately NOT budgeted for
 * population scale - she gets a wider awareness radius
 * (AI_QUEEN_ATTACK_DISTANCE/RETURN_DISTANCE).
 *
 * Capabilities:
 * - Throne + Hive Core: this is the hive's actual objective, not "commanding"
 *   flavor - "keep the hive core and ovipositor, allowing there to be an
 *   objective, if the hive core and the queen die, the xenos stop spawning."
 *   Builds the Hive Core on the ground before she's earned her throne, then
 *   once it's up and nothing's actively threatening her, mounts the
 *   ovipositor for real - "she can ovi for roleplay." Staying mounted keeps
 *   laying eggs (Life()'s own passive accumulation, unchanged) and, since
 *   Screech/the spit macro/shift_spits get force-granted to her the instant
 *   she mounts regardless of maturity (mount_ovipositor(), Queen.dm), she's
 *   never actually defenseless while sitting there even if she hasn't aged up
 *   naturally. She isn't idle on the throne either: she periodically uses
 *   expand_weeds (an ovi-exclusive remote-targeted ability) to grow the
 *   hive's territory without needing to physically move. Dismounting is
 *   always instant and unthrottled - a real threat is a reflex, not a
 *   decision - but re-mounting afterward waits out AI_QUEEN_REMOUNT_COOLDOWN
 *   so a borderline threat-check can't thrash her in and out of ovi tick
 *   after tick.
 * - Command: broadcasts a hive-wide alert (hive_status.dm's
 *   queen_alert_turf/queen_alert_time) whenever she has a live target -
 *   every other same-hive AI xeno checks this during idle patrol
 *   (xeno_ai_controller.dm's respond_to_hive_alert()) and heads there
 *   instead of wandering. This is how she "commands" the hive without a
 *   hard command hierarchy - deliberately the ONLY commanding behavior she
 *   has left; scout orders and threat-tier-driven LZ-siege-joining were
 *   removed as part of ripping out the Hive Population Director system
 *   (both were tied to it, and "the queen ordering the other aliens
 *   shouldn't be the only way they behave" - the rest of the hive scouts/
 *   weeds/patrols on its own initiative via the base controller's own
 *   long-patrol/wander machinery).
 * - Group Screech: "Screech is her most powerful ability" - when a target
 *   isn't alone (AI_QUEEN_GROUP_SCREECH_THRESHOLD or more hostiles clustered
 *   within AI_QUEEN_GROUP_SCREECH_RADIUS of it), she opens with Screech
 *   before closing the distance instead of only ever using it reactively
 *   once she's already adjacent and swinging.
 * - Last stand: overrides should_flee() so that when the base logic says
 *   she'd retreat (critically wounded/on fire) but she's the hive's only
 *   living member (or already backed by enough escorting daughters), she
 *   stands and fights instead - retreating would only delay the inevitable
 *   while abandoning the fight for nothing.
