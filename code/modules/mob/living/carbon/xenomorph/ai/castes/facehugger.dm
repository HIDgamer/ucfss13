/**
 * Facehugger AI - a pure ambush predator. Leap (the pounce ability) can hug
 * on landing regardless of whether the target is standing or lying down -
 * can_hug() (Facehuggers.dm) never checks body_position at all, only the
 * slow manual melee windup (UnarmedAttack()/execute_facehugger_hug()) is
 * restricted to LYING_DOWN targets. So the correct AI is: always prefer
 * leaping, at any range including already-adjacent, since it's strictly
 * better than the interruptible windup and works on anyone; only fall back
 * to approaching/waiting on the slow windup while Leap is on cooldown (a
 * short one, 3 seconds), which will only actually connect if the target
 * happens to already be down.
 *
 * Also hides (xenohide) while patrolling, same "lie in wait" identity the
 * caste already has via its own base_actions - nothing un-hides it again
 * since neither moving nor landing a hug breaks the hide (only a stat
 * change does, per the ability's own signal handler), which suits an
 * ambush predator fine.

 * **Real bug, not a tuning nit**: had no should_flee()/get_flee_threshold()

 * should_flee()'s "target's in the same rough shape, finish it" and "not
 * fighting alone" exceptions - both assume a xeno that can actually win a
 * fight, which she never can. This deliberately does NOT mirror larva.dm's
 * "flee from any spotted hostile" override - her whole gameplan is closing
 * distance and Leaping (process_movement()/attempt_leap() above, confirmed
 * correct this session), so should_flee() only needs to matter AFTER she's
 * actually taken real damage, at a much higher threshold than the
 * population default, with none of the base version's talk-herself-back-
 * into-a-fight exceptions.
