 * shared with the Queen's own patrol()). Combat/searching/returning behavior
 * is entirely inherited unchanged (see patrol() below - that's the only
 * override), so a target wandering into range mid-build still gets chased
 * and fought normally - "aid and assist in attacking" per the user, not a
 * builder that ignores threats.
 *
 * Also occasionally attempts a defensive resin wall at the hive perimeter
 * (attempt_build_defense(), xeno_ai_controller.dm) on top of plain weeding -
 * a real, if simple, "wall a chokepoint around the hive" placement instead
 * of only ever weeding wherever she happens to be standing.
