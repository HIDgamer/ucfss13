/**
 * Crusher AI - the hive's frontline tank: a slow, heavily-armored charger
 * built to soak damage and punch a hole in whatever's in front of it,
 * matching the user's "head-on scary" caste design (as opposed to
 * Ravager's hit-and-reposition style - see ravager.dm). Patrol/search
 * behavior is entirely inherited from the base controller - the three
 * overrides below are what make a Crusher feel different to fight:
 *
 * - While closing on a target still out of melee range, fires its Charge
 *   ability (a long dash that knocks down and hits hard on landing)
 *   instead of plodding over on foot - a Crusher is XENO_SPEED_TIER_2
 *   (the slowest AI caste built so far), so without this it would take
 *   noticeably longer than every other caste to actually reach a target.
 * - Stomps (a self-centered AoE) instead of a plain melee swing whenever
 *   more than one valid target is already in range, so a Crusher wading
 *   into a cluster of marines hits all of them, not just whichever one
 *   it happens to be facing.
 * - Flees at a much lower health fraction than the default - a Crusher
 *   is meant to be the wall the hive leans on, not a caste that breaks
 *   off at the first sign of trouble like a squishier one would.
 *
 * Also proactively pops its defensive Shield (explosion immunity + a
 * per-hit damage cap) once actually taking a beating (below half health)
 * but not yet at the much lower flee threshold - "hurt but still fighting,"
 * not a panic button held in reserve forever.
 *
 * Phase 3 audit note: deliberately has no post-attack reposition/dodge
 * logic (unlike Ravager/Warrior/etc's damage-reactive circle-step) - she's
 * the wall the hive leans on, standing and tanking IS her identity, not an
 * oversight. Base kit (Charge/Stomp/Shield) confirmed fully used and
 * sensibly gated; don't "fix" the missing dodge without re-reading this.
