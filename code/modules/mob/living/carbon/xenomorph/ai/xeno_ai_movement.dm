/**
 * Movement for xeno_ai_controller. When the native xeno_pathfind library is
 * present (see code/__DEFINES/__xeno_pathfind.dm), routes through a real A*
 * plan over a small local grid via advance_along_path() - this is what fixes
 * zigzagging and lets the AI route around walls properly. When it isn't
 * present (or a planned step fails - a mob wandered into the way, a door
 * closed), falls straight back to the original greedy step_towards() + one
 * tile sidestep. Either way a host with no native library at all behaves
 * exactly as before this was added.
 *
 * "Long pathfinding to go around a building or a wall is not possible, the
 * aliens just walk back and forth unable to find a path if outside and the
 * enemy is inside a big building." advance_along_path()'s real A* only ever
 * solves within a small local grid around pilot/goal (compute_path()'s own
 * margin, capped at XENO_PATHFIND_MAX_CELLS) - a detour around a whole
 * building is routinely far outside that box, so it correctly finds no plan
 * at all, and the greedy fallback below just walks straight at the wall
 * every tick, sidesteps one tile, then walks straight at the wall again -
 * that's the "back and forth." attempt_skirt_obstacle() (checked first, and
 * committed to by navigate_around() below) fixes this not by solving a real
 * long-range path, but by refusing to re-aim at the goal every single tick
 * while blocked: once a side is picked, she keeps walking that direction for
 * several seconds so she actually travels far enough to clear the corner,
 * instead of re-evaluating "which way is the goal" every tick and
 * potentially flip-flopping before ever making real progress.
